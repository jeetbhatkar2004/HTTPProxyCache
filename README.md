HTTP Proxy with Caching

This is an implementation of an HTTP proxy server in C++ supports caching of responses. The proxy server forwards requests from clients to origin servers and caches the responses it receives. When a client requests a resource that is in the cache, the proxy can respond with the cached copy of the resource rather than re-fetching it from the origin server.

Features

Handles multiple concurrent requests effectively using multiple threads
Logs information about each request to /var/log/erss/proxy.log
